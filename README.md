# ARDUINO SMART BATHROOM

This device is very helpful in keeping our bathroom always clean. This device uses a sensor that tells if someone has used the water properly when they enter the bathroom. If the person wants to open the bathroom door without using the water after using the bathroom, then this device does not allow the door to open. Also, this device uses a display that shows how much water the person has used and how much is left to use. Along with this, the display will inform the person about various important alerts. Also used here is the buzzer, which will give a beep alert if the person tries to open the door without using water.
